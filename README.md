How to start the application:  mvn clean spring-boot:run

How to build a .WAR:  mvn clean install

Design Pattern:

I have used the Model - View - Controller design pattern. Being a web application, it contains the UI component (Front End) along with back end and database. Also, 
it is easily possible to encapsulate POJO classes, endpoint Controller and Jsp pages using MVC pattern.
